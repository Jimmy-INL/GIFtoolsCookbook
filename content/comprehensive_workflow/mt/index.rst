Comprehensive Workflows (MT)
============================


This workflow is organized as follows:

.. toctree::
    :maxdepth: 1

    - Understanding MT anomalies from basic structures and MT coordinate systems <1_basic_anomalies>
    - Loading geophysical data and ascertaining if it is in GIF convention <2_load_data>
    - Standard assignment of uncertainties to MT data <3_uncertainties>
    - Preparing data for inversion within the GIFtools framework <4_data_preparation>
    - Mesh design <5_mesh_design>
    - Setting appropriate parameters and running the inversion <6_inversion>
    - Examining convergence, data misfit and the recovered model <7_results>
