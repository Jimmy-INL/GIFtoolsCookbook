Understanding DC and IP Data
============================

In order to properly interpret DC and IP data, it is import to first understand the characteristics of the anomalies due to basic structures. Here, we investigate the DC signatures produced by compact conductors and resistors. We also consider the IP signature when one of the structures is chargeable. The knowledge gained here can be used to infer a realistic background model and level of data uncertainty.
