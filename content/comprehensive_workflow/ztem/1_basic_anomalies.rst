Understanding ZTEM Anomalies
============================

In order to properly interpret ZTEM data, it is import to understand the shape and characteristics of ZTEM anomalies for basic structures. Here, we investigate the ZTEM anomalies produced by compact conductors and resistors. The knowledge gained here can be used to determine the coordinate system and sign convention for field collected data, and the operations required to transform the raw data into UBC GIF format.

ZTEM data definition
--------------------

The Z-Axis Tipper Electromagnetic Technique (ZTEM) records the vertical component of the magnetic field (:math:`H_z`) everywhere above the survey area while recording
the horizontal fields (:math:`H_x` and :math:`H_y` ) at a ground based reference station. The vertical and horizontal field measurements are related by the following transfer functions:

.. math::
    H_z = T_{zx} H_x + T_{zy} H_y
    :label:

For each location, we compute the transfer function values :math:`T_{zx}` and :math:`T_{zy}`, also known as Tippers. For a 3-dimensional Earth, the transfer functions can be defined using the magnetic field components for 2 orthogonal plane wave polarizations; for example, one polarization with the electric field along the x axis and one polarization with the electric file along the y axis. In this case,

.. math::
    \begin{bmatrix} H_z^{(1)} \\ H_z^{(2)} \end{bmatrix} =
    \begin{bmatrix} H_x^{(1)} & H_y^{(1)} \\ H_x^{(2)} & H_y^{(2)} \end{bmatrix}
    \begin{bmatrix} T_{zx} \\ T_{zy} \end{bmatrix}
    :label: transfer_fcn

where 1 and 2 refer to fields associated with plane waves polarized along two perpendicular directions. Solving for the transfer functions we obtain:

.. math::
    \begin{bmatrix} T_{zx} \\ T_{zy} \end{bmatrix} = \big ( H_x^{(1)} H_y^{(2)} - H_x^{(2)} H_y^{(1)} \big )^{-1}
    \begin{bmatrix} - H_y^{(1)} H_z^{(2)} + H_y^{(2)} H_z^{(1)} \\ H_x^{(1)} H_z^{(2)} - H_x^{(2)} H_z^{(1)} \end{bmatrix}

ZTEM data and coordinate conventions
------------------------------------

ZTEM data are generally defined using a right-handed coordinate system. The question becomes, what direction is x, y and z? And how does this impact the shape of the observed ZTEM anomalies?

**UBC-GIF** data are defined in a coordinate system where:
	
	- X is Northing
	- Y is Easting
	- Z is +ve downward

**Most airborne systems** define their data in a coordinate system where:
	
	- X is the along-line direction or "flight line direction" (degrees counter-clockwise from Northing)
	- Y is cross-line direction (90 degrees counter clockwise from along-line direction)
	- Z is +ve upwards

Below, we see the ZTEM anomalies for UBC-GIF modeled data and standard airborne data collected over the same compact conductor. The standard airborne data were collected along flight lines with a bearing of 45 degrees (from SW to NE). Thus the cross line direction is -45 degrees (SE to NW). Looking at these anomalies, we see that:

	- The response near the edges of the conductor is large and the response directly over the conductor is relatively small; as ZTEM measurements are sensitive to lateral changes in conductivity and not the conductor itself.
	- For UBC-GIF convention, the :math:`T_x` anomalies lie to the North and South of the conductor and :math:`T_y` anomalies lie to the East and West.
	- For standard airborne data, the :math:`T_x` anomalies are oriented along the flight-direction (along-line) and :math:`T_y` anomalies are oriented in the cross-line direction.

Anomaly over a compact conductor
--------------------------------

Let us work in the UBC-GIF ZTEM data convention; X is Northing, Y is Easting and Z is +ve downward. The real and imaginary components of the :math:`T_x` and :math:`T_y` anomalies over a conductive block are shown below. The conductor is buried at a depth of 200 m. Its East-West dimension is 2000 m and its North-South dimension is 1000 m. The background conductivity is 0.001 S/m and the conductivity of the block is 0.1 S/m. Over a conductor:

	- The response near the edges of the conductor is large and the response directly over the conductor is relatively small; as ZTEM measurements are sensitive to lateral changes in conductivity and not the conductor itself.
	- At lower frequencies, ZTEM anomalies are broader. At higher frequencies, ZTEM anomalies are more compact.
	- :math:`T_x` is sensitive to the North and South faces of the conductor while :math:`T_y` is sensitive to the East and West faces.
	- The real component of :math:`T_x` is always +ve to the North of the block and -ve to the South of the block.
	- The real component of :math:`T_y` is always +ve to the East of the block and -ve to the West of the block.
	- The imaginary component of :math:`T_x` is generally -ve to the North of the block and +ve to the South (opposite to what we see in the real component). At sufficiently high frequencies however, the imaginary component of :math:`T_x` can be +ve to the North of the block and -ve to the South of the block. The latter case occurs when EM induction effects become larger than the galvanic.
	- The imaginary component of :math:`T_y` is generally -ve to the East of the block and +ve to the West (opposite to what we see in the real component). At sufficiently high frequencies however, the imaginary component of :math:`T_y` can be +ve to the East of the block and -ve to the West of the block. The latter case occurs when EM induction effects become larger than the galvanic.

Anomaly over a compact resistor
-------------------------------

Let us work again in the UBC-GIF ZTEM data convention; X is Northing, Y is Easting and Z is +ve downward. The real and imaginary components of the :math:`T_x` and :math:`T_y` anomalies over a resistive block are shown below. The resistor is buried at a depth of 200 m. Its East-West dimension is 2000 m and its North-South dimension is 1000 m. The background conductivity is 0.001 S/m and the conductivity of the block is 0.1 S/m. Over a conductor:

	- The response near the edges of the resistor is large and the response directly over the resistor is relatively small; as ZTEM measurements are sensitive to lateral changes in conductivity and not the conductor itself.
	- :math:`T_x` is sensitive to the North and South faces of the conductor while :math:`T_y` is sensitive to the East and West faces.
	- The real component of :math:`T_x` is always +ve to the North of the block and -ve to the South of the block.
	- The real component of :math:`T_y` is always +ve to the East of the block and -ve to the West of the block.
	- The imaginary component of :math:`T_x` is generally -ve to the North of the block and +ve to the South (opposite to what we see in the real component). At sufficiently high frequencies however, the imaginary component of :math:`T_x` can be +ve to the North of the block and -ve to the South of the block. The latter case occurs when EM induction effects become larger than the galvanic.
	- The imaginary component of :math:`T_y` is generally -ve to the East of the block and +ve to the West (opposite to what we see in the real component). At sufficiently high frequencies however, the imaginary component of :math:`T_y` can be +ve to the East of the block and -ve to the West of the block. The latter case occurs when EM induction effects become larger than the galvanic.

.. _comprehensive_workflow_ztem_1_transformation:

Transforming data into UBC-GIF convention
-----------------------------------------


Let :math:`\theta` be the flight direction (counter-clockwise degrees from Northing). Let :math:`T_x` and :math:`T_y` be the Tipper data in the UBC-GIF coordinate system. And let :math:`T_{x'}` and :math:`T_{y'}` be the Tipper data in the field data coordinate system. To go from standard airborne data convention to UBC-GIF, the following transformation can be done:

.. math::
	\begin{bmatrix} T_x \\ T_y \end{bmatrix} = 
	- \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix}
	\begin{bmatrix} cos \theta & -sin\theta \\ sin\theta & cos\theta \end{bmatrix}
	\begin{bmatrix} T_{x'} \\ T_{y'} \end{bmatrix}

The operations being performed can be summarized as follows:

	- The rotation matrix is applied to rotate from flight orientation to Northing (if necessary).
	- The diagonal matrix transforms the cross-line direction from being 90 degrees counter clockwise relative to along-line direction, to being 90 degrees clockwise relative to along-line direction (if necessary).
	- The negative sign out front transform the coordinate system from being z +ve upwards to z +ve downwards (if necessary).


.. note:: This transformation has been built into GIFtools. We will demonstrate this in the workflow.


Example
^^^^^^^

When ZTEM data are acquired, the contractor will frequently provide the cross-over polarity for data collected along each flight direction (see below). Essentially, they provide the expected Re[Tx] anomaly, at sufficiently low frequency, over a compact conductor. So given this information, how do we determine the transformation required to go from the field coordinate system to UBC-GIF?

.. figure:: images/crossover_polarization.png
    :align: center
    :width: 400

    Convention for airborne data collected along 2 flight bearings.


In the figure above, we see the cross-over polarity for a survey that has data collected along two different flight line directions. We will deduce the transformation required to go from the field data coordinate system to UBC-GIF.

**Z +ve upward or Z +ve downward?**

From the figure, we see that the coordinate system for field collected data is defined using a z +ve upward convention, whereas UBC GIF uses a z +ve downward convention. Thus we will need to include this in our transformation.

**Is cross-line 90 degrees clockwise or 90 degrees counter clockwise from the along-line direction?**

From the figure, we see that the cross-line direction is 90 degrees counter clockwise from the along-line direction. UBC-GIF is 90 clockwise. Thus we will need to include this in our transformation.

**What is the flight line direction (along-line direction)?**

If the convention is z +ve upward, then as I fly over a compact conductor, I would see +ve Re[Tx] values followed by -ve Re[Tx] values (opposite if z +ve downward). So from the figure above, I have some data being collected from South to North (0 degrees). And I have some data being collected from Southeast to Northwest (-45 degrees). Thus for each set of flight lines, I must apply the correct rotation in my transformation.
