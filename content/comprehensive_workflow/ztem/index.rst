Comprehensive Workflows (ZTEM)
==============================


This workflow is organized as follows:

.. toctree::
	:maxdepth: 0

    - Understanding ZTEM anomalies from compact conductors, compact resistors and the impact of layered structures <1_basic_anomalies>
    - Loading geophysical data and transforming from along-line cross-line convention to GIF convention <2_load_data>



    .. - The general approach for assigning uncertainties to ZTEM data
    .. - Data down-sampling and mesh design in extreme topography regions
    .. - Inversion with E3DMT v1 and v2
