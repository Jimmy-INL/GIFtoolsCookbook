Laterally Constrained 3D Inversion
==================================

Here, time-domain data are inverted using the laterally constrained 3D
inversion code developed by the open-source community in Python. Just like the
:ref:`AtoZ Frequency EM1D<AtoZem1dfm_lateral>` example, individual 1D
inversions are constrained laterally such that the set of recovered 1D models
are smooth horizontally and can ultimately be constrained and interpreted in
3D. The collaborative work invested in `SimPEG
<https://github.com/simpeg/simpegEM1D>`_ and `empymod <https://empymod.github.io>`_ has improved the
lateral 1D inversion in many ways:

- Avoids the slow read/write of the legacy `EM1DTM file format <https://em1dtm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/content/files/supporting.html#observation-file>`_
- Parallelized forward modeling
- Efficient digital filtering scheme (`empymod <https://empymod.github.io>`_)

Laterally Constrained 3D TEM Inversion
--------------------------------------

.. figure:: ../../../images/AtoZ_fem1d/LC_fem1D.png
    :align: right
    :scale: 75%

Here, the set of TEM data are inverted using the laterally constrained 3D
approach.

Setup the inversion
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    - :ref:`Create an em1dtm inversion object <createTEMInv>` and set the output directory
    - Click on the newly created em1dtm inversion object to set the output directory
    - Set any necessary em1dtm inversion parameters under :ref:`edit options<invEditOptions>`:

        - **Global tab:**
            - *Mode panel:* set to laterally constrained 3D
            - Make sure the mesh, observed data and topography are properly set!
            - *Trade-off mode panel:* Use 'discrepancy' mode
            - Other parameters left as default values

        - **Conductivity tab:**
            - Set the initial conductivity as *Value* and set to 1e-3 S/m
            - Set the reference conductivity as *Value* and set to 1e-3 S/m

        - Click *Apply* (NOT *Apply and write*)


.. note:: You do NOT need to write all files, as the data and inversion parameters
          will be passed on to Python as ``HDF5`` file. This will save
          time by avoiding to read/write the legacy `EM1DTM file format <https://em1dtm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/content/files/supporting.html#observation-file>`_


Run Inversion and Load Results
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    .. figure:: ./../../../images/AtoZ_tem1d/SimpegEM1DRun.png
        :align: right
        :scale: 45%

    - :ref:`Run inversion <invRun>` (SimPEG)
        - Inversion progress will be displayed in a command prompt
        - Results will be loaded automatically at the end of the inversion

    - :ref:`View the model <objectModelView>`

    - :reF:`View the misfit map <viewData>`


The lateral constraints strategy comes with many advantages:

    - Neighboring 1D conductivity models are more consistent
    - Conductivity structures are interpolated in 3D, possibly highlighting trends in the model and easing the interpretation.
    - Possible to employ a :math:`\beta`-cooling strategy similar to the 3D inversion code.

.. _AtoZem1dtm_lateral_discussion:


Discussion
^^^^^^^^^^

The use of a global measure of data fit allows us to assess the convergence of
the algorithm through the usual :ref:`convergence curve<convergence_curve>` window.

.. figure:: ./../../../images/AtoZ_tem1d/ConvergenceCurve.png
    :align: center
    :width: 85%


Inspecting the model and the residual data map we note the following
    - Convergence to the target misfit is not attained, leveling off above the target (:math:`\phi_d = 5670`)
    - Large data residuals over the main anomalies
    - Normalized residual within one standard deviation over the background.

The poor data fit of the kimberlite pipes is likely due to the 1D
approximation of a compact 3D structure. Note that the recovered model shows a
large conductor at depth, which is not consistent with our conceptual
understanding of the deposit.

Inversion #2
^^^^^^^^^^^^

We will attempt to improve the previous result:

    - From the :ref:`Uncertainties GUI <objectAssignUncertGUI>` , add 5% error to the existing uncertainties. This will require you to assign the uncertainties for each time channel individually.
    - Click on the last EM1DTM inversion object and :ref:`copy options<invCopyOptions>`
    - Use :ref:`edit options<invEditOptions>` to verify the the original set of inversion parameters are set. Also:

        - In the *Tradeoff Mode* panel, increase the *Max beta iterations* to 25
        - Change the starting and reference models to *Best-fitting Halfspace*

    - Apply changes
    - :ref:`Run inversion <invRun>`

The inversion should now have converged more easily to the target.
Following the l2-norm inversion, the inversion routine will attempt to run a sparse inversion.
You should see 3 models in the ``ModelsCond`` folder:

    :file: ./AtoZ_Model_Inv2.html

We have recovered a pipe-like body below the surface. Both the smooth l2-norm and
sparse lp-norm give similar results in this case. Normalize residual data
maps show a more uniform data fit:

.. note:: Congratulation, you have inverted Time-Domain EM data in 1D with the open-source inversion routines `SimPEG
          <https://github.com/simpeg/simpegEM1D>`_ + `empymod <https://empymod.github.io>`_! You are invited to try the Python algorithm on the :ref:`AtoZ FEM1D example <AtoZem1dfm_lateral>`
